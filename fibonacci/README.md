# arm/fibonacci

## Fibonacci

One way to gain an understanding of the assembly language of a particular
machine is to look at the assembly code that a compiler generates.
That was my goal with the fib.c program. By looking at the .s file
generated by either CLANG or GCC and annotating that code, I will learn
a lot about the ARM processor and instruction set.
